            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan. </li>
                <li> Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. </li>
                <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract. </li>
                <li>Add flour mixture in batches, alternating with milk, mixing just until combined. </li>
                <li>Reserve 3/4 cup batter; pour remaining batter into the prepared pan. </li>
                <li>Mix cocoa into reserved cake batter until even in color. </li>
                <li>Drop chocolate batter by large spoonfuls on top of vanilla batter and swirl with a knife for a marbled effect. </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 28 to 30 minutes. Cool briefly on a wire rack before inverting carefully onto a cooling rack. Let cool completely before slicing. </li>
            </ol>
